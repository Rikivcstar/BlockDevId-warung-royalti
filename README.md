Problem Statement

In Indonesia, many small shop (warung) customers do not receive any royalties or rewards for their transactions.
In addition, warung owners face difficulties tracking customers’ purchase history.

Current Conditions:
- Purchase data is not integrated and is difficult to trace.
- There are no incentives to maintain customer loyalty, making it easy for customers to switch to other shops.

How It Works:

1. Warung owners mint (create) digital tokens.
2. Each time a customer makes a transaction, tokens are sent to the customer’s digital wallet in a **transparent, instant, and secure** manner.
3. Tokens can be accumulated and redeemed according to the shop’s policy (e.g., exchanged for discounts or free products).

Advantages

Transparency : All transactions are recorded on the blockchain.
Instant : Rewards are granted immediately after the transaction.
Security : Data cannot be altered or lost.

For Customers

Receive rewards immediately after purchase.
Have a secure and permanent digital proof of transactions.
Feel more valued, increasing the likelihood of continuing to shop at the same warung.
